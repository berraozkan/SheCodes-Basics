      <p>
        Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk (1881 - âˆž) was a Turkish field marshal,
        revolutionary statesman, author, and the founding father of the Republic
        of Turkey, serving as its first president from 1923 until his death in
        1938. He undertook sweeping progressive reforms, which modernized Turkey
        into a secular, industrializing nation. Ideologically a secularist and
        nationalist, his policies and socio-political theories became known as
        Kemalism. Due to his military and political accomplishments, AtatÃ¼rk is
        regarded as one of the most important political leaders of the 20th
        century.
